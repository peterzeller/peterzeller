I am a software developer interested in:

 - software correctness (formal verification and automated testing)
 - tooling for software development (compiler and IDE development)
 - distributed systems and concurrency

# Projects

## Repliss

I developed the Repliss verification tool as part of my PhD thesis.
It is a prototype for verifying highly available information systems that are built on top of weakly consistent databases such as Antidote.

## Antidote

I contributed to Antidote, a highly available distributed database with support for transactions and replicated data types (CRDTs).

## Verified Replicated Data Types

I verified some CRDTs in Isabelle/HOL

## Automatic Testing Libraries

I wrote prototypes of testing libraries to test some ideas regarding API design.

- https://github.com/peterzeller/java-smallcheck An implementation of SmallCheck for Java
- https://github.com/peterzeller/smallcheck4scala An implementation of SmallCheck for Scala (forked and extended from https://github.com/dwhjames/smallcheck4scala)
- https://github.com/peterzeller/dorEr An Erlang library for testing stateful systems with randomized tests with a more intuitive API than QuickCheck or Proper.
- https://github.com/peterzeller/go-stateful-test A Go library for testing stateful systems with randomized (QuickCheck) and exhaustive (SmallCheck) tests. This combines some learnings from the older testing libraries above.

## Functional Programming

- https://github.com/peterzeller/go-fun Functional data structures for Go.


## AST generator

I wrote a code generator for classes representing abstract syntax trees, which can be used for building compilers.

- https://github.com/peterzeller/abstractsyntaxgen

## Pretty Printing Library

A Scala implementation of Wadlers pretty printing algorithm.

- https://github.com/peterzeller/scala-prettyprint

## Logic Evaluator

A Scala library for evaluating logical formulas with quantifiers using a simple narrowing technique.

- https://github.com/peterzeller/logic-evaluator

## Wurst Programming Language

I am one of the two inventors and core developers of the Wurst programming language.
